This project is a simple Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page, developed using pure HTML and CSS. It presents two common questions with their respective answers, styled to be clear and easy to read. The layout is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I had the opportunity to solidify my fundamental knowledge of HTML and CSS. The main learning and reinforcement points include:

-   **Semantic HTML:** The application of HTML5 tags such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<ol>`, `<ul>`, and `<strong>` to structure the content logically, improving accessibility and code understanding.
-   **CSS Organization:** The practice of modularizing CSS into separate files (`reset.css`, `header.css`, `main.css`, and `style.css`). This approach results in a cleaner, more organized, and easier-to-maintain and scale codebase.
-   **CSS Variables (Custom Properties):** The use of CSS variables defined in the `:root` block to manage colors. This ensures visual consistency throughout the project and facilitates future theme changes.
-   **Basic Responsive Design:** The implementation of `@media queries` to adjust the page layout across different screen widths, ensuring an optimized user experience on both mobile devices and desktops.
-   **List Styling:** The correct application of `list-style: decimal` for ordered lists and `list-style: disc` for unordered lists, contributing to the clarity and organization of information.
